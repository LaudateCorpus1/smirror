# Cloud Storage Mirror

Cross cloud vendor serverless storage mirror.


## Motivation

When dealing with various cloud providers, it is a frequent use case to move seamlessly data from one cloud storage to another. 
In some scenarios, you may also need to split transferred content into a few smaller chunks. 
In any cases facilitating compression and post processing for both successful and failed transfer would be just additional requirement.
